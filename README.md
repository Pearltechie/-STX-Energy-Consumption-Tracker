STX Energy Consumption Tracker

This is a simple Python-based tool to calculate the energy consumption of Stacks transactions. The tracker allows you to input the number of Stacks transactions and the estimated energy used per transaction to calculate the total energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).

 1. Features

 Calculate total energy consumption for your Stacks transactions.
Get an energy-saving suggestion based on your input.
Simple to use and can be customized for different energy consumption rates per transaction.

2. Installation

2.1 Prerequisites

Python 3.3 or higher.

A text editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other IDE of your choice.

2.2 Steps to Run the Project:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stx-energy-consumption-tracker.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd stx-energy-consumption-tracker
```
Ensure you have Python installed. If you don't have Python, download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org)

Run the Python script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python stx_energy_tracker.py
```

Follow the instructions to input the number of transactions and energy per transaction.


3. Usage

  3.1 Example Output:

  ```bash
STX Energy Consumption Tracker
Calculate the energy consumption of your Stacks transactions.
Enter the number of transactions: 100
Enter energy per transaction in kWh (default 0.0015):
Total energy consumption: 0.150000 kWh
Energy-saving suggestion: Consider using renewable energy sources for blockchain nodes
```

3.2 Inputs:

Number of transactions: Enter the total number of transactions you made or plan to make on the Stacks blockchain.

Energy per transaction: The estimated energy consumption per transaction in kilowatt-hours (kWh). The default value is 0.0015 kWh.

3.3 Outputs:

Total energy consumption: The total energy consumed for the number of transactions you entered.

Energy-saving suggestion: A suggestion for reducing the energy consumption, like using renewable energy sources.
